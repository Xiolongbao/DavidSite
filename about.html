                <p1>I’m a 29-year-old fitness enthusiast <br> from Philippines . My journey into fitness began during the challenging times of 2020, when the world was grappling with the pandemic. Like many, I found myself at home, and after realizing how a sedentary lifestyle was affecting my health, I decided it was time for a change. What started as simple bodyweight exercises in my living room soon turned into a transformative journey.</p1>

            <h2>My Fitness Journey</h2>
            <p>In early 2020, I felt sluggish and uninspired, but the pandemic prompted<br> me to take my health seriously. I began with basic workouts—push-ups,<br>
                 squats, and yoga—all from the comfort of my home. As I started to see<br> progress, I became motivated to learn more about fitness and nutrition.<br>
                 This sparked a desire to share my experiences and connect with others <br>who might be facing similar challenges.<br>
                Through my blog, I document every step of my fitness journey, from the<br> early struggles of building a routine to the triumphs of hitting personal <br>
                records in the gym. I believe in the power of community, and I want to <br>create a space where we can support and motivate each other
