            <h2>2019: The "Building Consistency" Phase</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    At the start of 2019, I wasn’t too focused on fitness. I’d go for <br> the occasional jog, maybe join friends for a game of basketball, <br>
                    but I didn’t have any solid goals. My focus was mainly on work <br> and social life. I didn’t think much about hitting the gym or <br>
                    setting a consistent workout schedule. But as the year went on,<br> I started feeling the effects of a sedentary lifestyle—lower <br>energy, poor posture, and the occasional backache from sitting<br> too long. I promised myself I’d start working out in 2020 to <br>make a change.

                <h2>2020: The "Lockdown Low" Phase</h2>
                <p>
                    Then, the pandemic hit. Like everyone else, I found myself at home,<br> adjusting to a whole new “normal.” Gyms were closed, and working from<br>
                     home made it too easy to stay in pajamas all day. By mid-2020, I felt the <br>effects of inactivity and stress piling up. My energy levels were lower than <br>
                     ever, and I was sluggish, struggling to keep a regular sleep schedule, and <br>feeling cooped up in my own home.<br> That’s when I decided to make a change.
                     I started with basic bodyweight <br>exercises at home—push-ups, squats, and some yoga from YouTube <br>videos. My setup wasn’t ideal, but it was something, and I stuck with it.

            <h2>2021: The "Building Consistency" Phase</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    2021 was all about committing to small, manageable routines. <br>With lockdown restrictions still in place, I didn’t have access<br> to a gym, so I adapted.
                     I invested in a couple of dumbbells and <br>resistance bands and dedicated a corner of my living room to <br>my “home gym.” The goal was simple: 3-4 days of
                     working out<br>each week, combining bodyweight exercises, light weights,<br> and some cardio. It was tough initially, but I pushed through.<br>By the end of the year, 
                    I was proud of the progress I’d made—<br>I was feeling more energized, had built a bit of strength, and <br>even saw some noticeable improvements in my body.

                <h2>2022: The “Back to the Gym” Phase</h2>
                <p>
                    Gyms reopened in 2022, and I was more than ready to level up my routine.<br> I finally joined a local gym and introduced myself to more structured workouts,<br>
                     working on form and technique. I focused on full-body routines, mixing in basic<br> compound movements like squats, lunges, and dumbbell presses. It felt empowering,<br>
                      lifting weights and seeing steady progress. I kept it manageable, going to the gym<br> three times a week and spending two more days on cardio.
                     It was during this time <br>that I fell in love with the process. The gym became my stress relief and my way of building resilience. <br> By the end of 2022, my energy levels were high,
                     my body was changing, and I started craving the<br> challenge of lifting heavier and pushing harder.

            <h2>2023: The “Strength and Muscle-Building” Phase</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    With the basics under my belt, I set my sights on more<br> specific goals in 2023. I transitioned to a four-day split routine:<br> two days for upper body, 
                    one for lower, and one for core<br> and cardio. I set mini-goals for each workout—whether that <br>was adding 5 pounds to my lifts or increasing reps.<br> By mid-year, 
                    I was starting to see real muscle definition and <br>an increase in strength. 2023 was also the year I took <br>nutrition seriously.  I focused on hitting protein goals,<br> 
                    eating more balanced meals, and incorporating recovery into <br>my routine (hello, foam roller). I loved seeing the way it all<br> came together—energy, strength, 
                    and mental clarity. I shared<br> my nutrition tips and meal prep ideas on the blog, aiming<br> to inspire readers to take their 
                    diets seriously, <br>just like I was.

                <h2>2024: The "Lockdown Low" Phase</h2>
                <p>
                    Now it’s 2024, and I’m feeling stronger than I ever imagined. My workout routine has become part of who I am. I’ve transitioned into a five-day split: push, pull, legs, core, and a focus day
                    for whatever muscle group I want to work on. My lifts are heavier, I’m setting new personal records, <br> and I’ve added more advanced techniques like pyramid sets and supersets.
                    The consistency, discipline, and resilience I’ve built over these years have become a solid foundation, and I’m more motivated than ever to keep challenging myself. <br>The gym is no longer just a 
                    place to exercise; it’s my way of life. As my fitness journey continues, so does my blog. I’ve created a supportive community where I share not <br>just my successes but also the challenges that 
                    come with pursuing fitness. It’s been incredible connecting with others who are on their journeys, too.

            <p>If there’s one thing this journey has taught me, it’s that consistency is everything. Starting from home <br> workouts to lifting weights at the gym, this journey has transformed me in ways I couldn’t <br>have imagined in 2019. Whether you’re just getting started or looking to level up, remember it’s all about the<br> small steps. Each workout, every rep, every rest day—it all adds up. Here’s to the journey ahead!</p>
